# Basic Spell Checker

## Brief

Make a spell checker for Basic English

Time allowed: Up to 1 hour for research & planning, 1 hour for development

## Background

British American Scientific International Commercial (Basic) English is a constructed language. It has 850 English words, carefully chosen to make the language easy to learn but still powerful enough to communicate everyday ideas and actions. The rules of usage are identical to full English, so the speaker communicates in perfectly good, but simple, English.

This XKCD webcomic shows an example of communicating a complicated idea (the blueprints for the Saturn V rocket) using Basic English: https://xkcd.com/1133. To help authors writing in Basic English it would be helpful to use a spell checker that tells them when they are using Basic English.

## Objectives

The main objective is to build a working Basic English spell checker within the time allowed (~1h for research/planning, ~1h hour for development). This is not a lot of time, so consider how you scope your solution within the time constraints.

We are interested in how you think about solving user problems as well as the code that you write, so the task is deliberately left open for you to consider what the user experience should be like, or could be like given more time! There are no right or wrong answers, but you should consider what would people expect or be familiar with from a spell checker.

Similarly, we do not specify which tools you can use to implement the spell checker. We are most familiar with JavaScript (as that is what we primarily use at Overleaf), but use whichever tools you feel are best for the job.
